Fruit Classification AI Model
Overview:
This AI model is designed to classify different types of fruits from input images. It has been trained both from scratch and using transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture.
Dataset:
The dataset used for training consists of images of various fruits categorized into different classes.
Ensure the dataset follows a structured format with separate folders for each class of fruit.
Model:
The model architecture used is VGG16 For training from scratch, the model is initialized randomly and trained on the dataset. For transfer learning, the pretrained VGG16 model is loaded and fine-tuned on the dataset.
